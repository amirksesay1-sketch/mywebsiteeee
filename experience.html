      <h2>What I’ve Worked On</h2>
      <p>
        Over the course of my academic and extracurricular journey, I’ve immersed myself in projects that bring together analytics, economics, and real-world problems. For example, I explored predictive modelling in economic contexts, designed visual dashboards to support decision-making, and collaborated with peers to translate raw data into strategic recommendations. Each project taught me the importance of asking the right question, selecting the correct methodology, and clearly communicating insights.
      </p>
      <p>
        My experience includes working with compliance data to streamline HR dashboard, transforming call data to improve customer service strategies. I have also contributed to project management teams to manage timelines and manage allocated budget.
